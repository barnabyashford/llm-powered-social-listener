People have mentioned his court case and him likely being sued, but I mean the UFC punishment for attacking a UFC bus and injuring UFC fighters and ruining an event that happened the next day. \n\nSo when you let the \u201cface\u201d of your company literally break the law and hurt your fighters and proclaim that Khabib would\u2019ve been killed had he got off the bus, and your reaction (as a COMPANY- I\u2019m talking the UFC here) is to give him a title shot and contract, you set a precedent for lawlessness. \n\nAgain, I think that Khabib (and his cornermen) went WAY over the line, deserves a severe punishment and the belt to be stripped. \n\nBut again, I\u2019ll ask, how does a company draw the line when they use violent lawlessness as a promotional tool (the bus incident in footage to promote fight) and then seem outraged when someone snaps as a result?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ufc","subreddit_id":"t5_2qsev","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ufc","subreddit_subscribers":143041,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"spoiler","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Khabib\u2019s Punishment (SPOILER)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ufc\/comments\/9m2taz\/khabibs_punishment_spoiler\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6,"post_hint":null,"preview":null,"media_metadata":null,"llm_summary":"# Submission Summarization\n\n## Main Summary\n\nThe Reddit submission on r\/ufc discusses the potential punishment for Khabib Nurmagomedov following his actions after the Conor McGregor fight, with the author arguing that while Khabib's actions were wrong and deserve punishment, the UFC's lenient treatment of Conor McGregor's past transgressions, particularly the bus attack, contributed to the situation. The comments section debates the severity of Khabib's actions, the role of Conor's behavior in instigating the conflict, and the potential consequences, including suspensions, fines, and the stripping of the title.

The author argues that Khabib is being unfairly criticized and potentially facing harsher penalties (visa revocation, title stripping) compared to McGregor, despite McGregor's history of controversial behavior. The post highlights instances where McGregor acted inappropriately, often without significant repercussions from the UFC or fans, and suggests a double standard exists due to financial incentives and McGregor's popularity. The comments section further debates the fairness of potential punishments, the UFC's motivations, and the role of religion and cultural differences in shaping perceptions of the fighters' actions.\n\n## Summary by aspects\n\n- **Double Standards and Hypocrisy**: The core argument revolves around the perceived double standard in how McGregor and Khabib are treated. McGregor's past transgressions (attacking a bus, incidents at Bellator, etc.) are contrasted with the potential severe consequences Khabib faces for his post-fight actions.\n- **UFC's Motivations**: Many commenters believe the UFC prioritizes financial gain (PPV buys) over fair treatment and consistent disciplinary action. This is seen as a reason why McGregor has been seemingly protected in the past.\n- **Khabib's Actions and Justification**: The submission defends Khabib's post-fight actions as a response to McGregor and Dillon Danis's insults, particularly those targeting his family and religion. However, some commenters argue that Khabib should have maintained his composure after winning the fight.\n- **Conor's Actions and Justification**: Some commenters defend Conor's actions as part of the \"fight game\" and promotional hype, while others condemn them as crossing the line into personal attacks and illegal behavior.\n- **Potential Consequences**: The discussion includes speculation about potential punishments for Khabib, such as being stripped of his title, suspended, or having his visa revoked. The possibility of a rematch is also discussed, along with the potential for other fighters to be given title shots if Khabib is suspended.\n- **Role of Religion and Culture**: Some commenters bring up the role of religion and cultural differences in shaping perceptions of the fighters' actions. Some argue that Khabib's public persona as a devout Muslim creates higher expectations for his behavior, while others suggest that cultural differences explain his reaction to insults against his family and religion.\n- **Athletic Commission vs. UFC**: Some commenters point out that the Nevada State Athletic Commission, not the UFC, is responsible for disciplinary actions like fines and suspensions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Reddit submission and its comments reflect a contentious debate surrounding the aftermath of the Khabib vs. McGregor fight. The central theme is the perceived hypocrisy in how the two fighters are treated, with many arguing that Khabib is facing disproportionate criticism and potential punishment compared to McGregor, despite McGregor's history of controversial behavior. The discussion also touches on the UFC's motivations, the role of religion and culture, and the potential consequences for both fighters.\n"}

Some users claim to have heard and seen it, while others are more focused on the overall dominance Khabib displayed in the fight.\n- **Champion's Conduct**: A significant portion of the discussion revolves around the expectations of a champion.

They suggest that McGregor's actions warranted a response, even if it was unsportsmanlike.\n- **Hypocrisy and Double Standards**: Several users point out the perceived hypocrisy in Khabib's actions, as he often speaks about respect and humility.

Some believe it's necessary to maintain the integrity of the sport, while others argue that his victory should stand, and he shouldn't be punished too severely.\n- **Role Model Debate**: The discussion extends to the role model status of both fighters.

While some condemn his behavior as unprofessional and unbecoming of a champion, others justify it as a response to McGregor's prior provocations. The discussion highlights the complexities of sportsmanship, the expectations placed on champions, and the impact of personal beliefs and cultural backgrounds on athletes' behavior. The overall sentiment suggests that Khabib's actions have tarnished his victory in the eyes of some, while others remain supportive due to McGregor's history and the intensity of the rivalry.\n"}

The user argues that Khabib's win was \"sad\" because it took him four rounds to defeat McGregor, who had been away from MMA for two years and accepted the fight on short notice. The user also questions Khabib's performance in round 3 and his inability to knock out McGregor. This post ignited a heated debate in the comments, primarily filled with insults, accusations of being a \"casual\" fan, and arguments about the dominance of Khabib in the fight.\n\n## Summary by aspects\n\n- **Original Poster's Argument**: The original poster (OP) believes Khabib's win was underwhelming, pointing to McGregor winning a round and not being finished. They question Khabib's dominance and suggest he is not as great as people claim.\n- **Dominance Debate**: A central argument revolves around whether Khabib truly \"mauled\" Conor, with many commenters pointing to the statistics and overall control Khabib exhibited in the fight, while the OP emphasizes McGregor winning a round as evidence against complete dominance.\n- **\"Casual\" Accusations**: Many commenters dismiss the OP's views by labeling them a \"casual\" fan, implying a lack of knowledge and understanding of MMA. This leads to further arguments and insults.\n- **Insults and Trolling**: The comment section is rife with insults, name-calling, and accusations of trolling. Many users resort to personal attacks rather than engaging in constructive discussion.\n- **McGregor's Performance**: Some commenters defend McGregor, citing his time away from the sport and the short notice for the fight as factors affecting his performance. Others argue that these are excuses and that Khabib was simply the better fighter.\n- **Rematch Potential**: Some users discuss the possibility of a rematch, with some believing it would solidify Khabib's superiority and others hoping McGregor could redeem himself.\n- **Conor's Marketability**: A few comments touch on Conor McGregor's marketability and his ability to generate revenue for the UFC, regardless of his recent performance.\n- **Illegitimate moves**: Some users point out that Conor cheated during the fight by grabbing the cage and Khabib's gloves.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Reddit thread is a prime example of the polarized opinions surrounding the Khabib vs. McGregor fight. The original post, questioning the impressiveness of Khabib's victory, sparked a highly contentious debate filled with insults, dismissals, and varying perspectives on the fighters' performances and the overall outcome of the match. The discussion highlights the passionate and often toxic nature of online MMA fandom.\n"}

The original poster (OP) argues that Conor's extreme behavior was necessary to sell the fight, as Khabib didn't engage in trash talk. Commenters largely disagree, stating that Conor's insults towards Khabib's family, religion, and personal beliefs went beyond business and provoked a personal response from Khabib.

While some believe Conor McGregor's behavior was a necessary evil to sell the fight, most commenters feel he crossed into unacceptable personal territory, provoking a justified response from Khabib Nurmagomedov. The discussion reveals differing perspectives on the role of trash talk in sports and the importance of respecting cultural and personal boundaries.\n"}

The comments section largely agrees that a rematch is undeserved based on performance, but acknowledges the financial incentives for the UFC to make it happen. Many suggest Conor should fight other top contenders first, while some believe the fight is inevitable due to McGregor's drawing power.\n\n## Summary by aspects\n\n- **Deservingness of a Rematch**: The overwhelming consensus is that Conor McGregor does not deserve an immediate rematch due to his one-sided loss to Khabib. Many feel he needs to prove himself against other top lightweights first.\n- **Financial Incentive**: Despite the lack of merit, the potential for massive profits is a major factor pushing for a rematch. The UFC is seen as a business, and McGregor is a huge draw.\n- **Tony Ferguson's Claim**: Many commenters highlight Tony Ferguson's long win streak and argue that he is the most deserving challenger for Khabib's title.\n- **Conor's Performance and Cheating**: The submission and many comments point out Conor's poor performance and alleged cheating during the fight (grabbing shorts, gloves, fence, illegal knee). This further diminishes the argument for a rematch.\n- **Conor's Future**: Some speculate about Conor's future in the UFC, suggesting he may only take fights where he is heavily favored to protect his brand. Others suggest potential matchups like Nate Diaz 3, or fights against Poirier, Barboza or Pettis.\n- **Khabib's Dominance**: The discussion acknowledges Khabib's dominance in the fight and his overall strength as a fighter, with some even surprised by his striking ability.\n- **Alternative Matchups**: Some users suggest alternative matchups for both fighters, such as Khabib vs. GSP or Conor vs. Nate Diaz 3, before considering a rematch.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Reddit thread reflects a strong sentiment against an immediate rematch between Khabib and Conor due to the one-sided nature of their first fight and Conor's perceived lack of deservingness. However, the discussion also acknowledges the significant financial incentives that could lead the UFC to book the rematch despite sporting merit. The thread also highlights Tony Ferguson's claim to a title shot and discusses potential future matchups for both Khabib and Conor.\n"}

The comments section is filled with differing opinions, debating the definitions of racism and bigotry, citing specific instances of McGregor's behavior, and arguing about his intent and whether his words crossed the line into racism or were simply inflammatory to promote the fight.\n\n## Summary by aspects\n\n- **Definition of Racism vs. Bigotry**: A significant portion of the discussion revolves around the difference between racism and bigotry, with many arguing that McGregor's comments, if offensive, were more aligned with religious or cultural bigotry rather than racism, as Islam is not a race. Some argue that racism is a specific form of bigotry.\n- **Specific Examples of McGregor's Behavior**: Commenters bring up examples such as McGregor mocking Khabib's religion by sarcastically using Muslim phrases, referencing Khabib's father and Russian politics, and Dillon Danis calling Khabib a \"Muslim rat.\" The intent and interpretation of these actions are heavily debated.\n- **McGregor's Intent**: Some argue that McGregor's behavior was purely to promote the fight and get under Khabib's skin, while others believe his comments reflected genuine prejudice. Some suggest it's impossible to know his true intent without being inside his mind.\n- **Perception of McGregor**: Some commenters share negative opinions of McGregor's character, citing his association with criminal elements in Ireland, while others defend him as being friendly with people of all nations and cultures.\n- **Context of Trash Talk**: Several users point out that trash talk is common in UFC to promote fights, and that McGregor's comments should be viewed in that context, even if they were offensive.\n- **Racial Identity**: Some users argue that since both McGregor and Khabib are white, racism is not possible.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe discussion surrounding whether Conor McGregor was racist towards Khabib Nurmagomedov is complex and multifaceted. While some believe his words and actions crossed the line into racism, others argue that they were simply inflammatory tactics to promote the fight or, at worst, examples of religious or cultural bigotry. The debate highlights the difficulty in defining and identifying racism, as well as the subjective nature of interpreting intent and impact.\n"}

Khabib has announced that he will quit the UFC if Zubaira is fired - the guy who punched Conor. I think it's understandable, since these people are so close-knit and treat one another like family. \n\nBut, I'm pissed. I'm pissed at how the UFC is handling all of this shit. I'm pissed with the double standards. \n\nKhabib is an incredible fighter, just like Conor is. But Khabib has been treating extremely unfairly by the UFC while the UFC continues to back anything Conor does. I can understand that Conor brings in the numbers and sells fights but the UFC shouldn\u2019t let money and profits gain superiority over the integrity of the support and should treat all fighters equally. Here are a couple of issues I want answered:\n\n1. Why did Dana just quickly announce that he is firing Zubaira? We have all seen the footage of the Brawl. Yes, Khabib jumped over the cage first but there would have been no in-cage brawl if Conor hadn\u2019t punched Khabib\u2019s team mate. That one punch from Conor literally started the in-cage brawl. So if Dana fires Zubaira for punching McGregor, will he also fire McGregor for punching Khabib\u2019s team mate first? I don\u2019t think so boi.\n2. Secondly, why the fuck is no one talking about how lenient Herb Deam (the ref) was with McGrgeor? McGregor cheated at multiple occasions throughout the fight. He grabbed Khabibs shorts, hooked his gloves, grabbed the cage with his feet, illegally hit Khabib with his knee when he was down. Just see for yourself - [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ufKOYmyX--o](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ufKOYmyX--o)\n3. When Conor threw the dolly, almost killed a number of people and messed up with a number of scheduled events, why did Dana just sit back and enjoy the ride. Why was Conor not suspended then? Hell, that footage was used for promotion and raised a lot of questions.  \n4. Why is Dana blatantly ignoring the UFC code of conduct (CoC) ([https:\/\/canadianmmalawblog.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/ufc-code-of-conduct.pdf](https:\/\/canadianmmalawblog.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/ufc-code-of-conduct.pdf)). It clearly says that no religious, ethnic\/racial, family oriented remarks will be tolerated. Why has Dana allowed all of this to go through completely ignoring the CoC? What Conor did with the bus thing was also completely against the CoC. I know he dealt with legal consequences but there was nothing from the UFC. Khabib will deal with legal consequences but he and his teammates are also dealing with set backs from the UFC. Is this not hypocrisy?\n5. Khabib\u2019s fight purse has been held for the melee. But what about Conor\u2019s? He did throw the first in-cage punch. Why was he let off? I know the NSAC has got to do with this but Dana acted like McGregor was completely guilt free. \n\nLet me know what y\u2019all think. This is just my opinion. Feel free to respectfully disagree.

However, I think a large UFC audience would be lost if Khabib goes and I feel like the UFC doesn't want to say goodbye to a McGregor vs Khabib 2 fight. But, I think Daniel Cormier should take a stand alongside Khabib. The man is a two weight champ. Khabib himself is the champ. They are both bros.

Nonetheless both are very talented in the sport of MMA.\n\nI'm muslim, I'm only mentioning that because I feel it's relevant for some of the points I want to make. I've been a supporter of McGregor before I got behind Khabib, however I'm a supporter of both because they're both amazing fighters. Going into this fight I was pretty much neutral on who I was rooting for to win. So was win-win for me. Even where I went to watch the fight at a sports bar, fans were calling each other bitches which wasn't necessary at all.\n\nI'd like to state the obvious that with McGregor this event and any past bouts he has been a part of were made into these giant spectacles because he is a showman. He speaks big, he says questionable things and basically makes a \"big drama show\" out of the fight. Fighters like him is why MMA is becoming as big as it is. \n\nKhabib a devout Muslim, from Dagestan has a much different upbringing I'm sure. At least very different than Conor. They have a different way of looking at things, and I know that firsthand because there are people I talk to who are very reactive to certain things in the sense that they will become defensive when specific things are said. In this case Conor used those things to get under Khabib's skin, comments about him being a backwards c***, his father etc. I'm impressed that Khabib let it build up and brought it out in the fight itself. Unfortunately it did go a bit far when the fight left the octagon. I'm not going to say it was right or wrong, but those involved will face consequences for their actions.\n\nNow for Conor, if you look at his past bouts and exchanges he is a master of mental warfare, if you beat your opponent prior to the physical fight it definitely is an edge. In this story it just didn't go as planned since Khabib wasn't mentally broken, but instead even more driven to destroy his opponent. Another point Conor is humble in victory or defeat, if you listen to his interviews in the past he has spoken about how both fighters need one another. He respects his opponent at least publicly after the show is over. So for those completely shitting on him saying he's a bitch, give it a rest, things got heated, and it got out of control.\n\nBtw not making any excuses for Conor's dolly incident in NYC.\n\nAs a Muslim I was raised with the idea that I must be respectful, if I'm taunted first I can decide to respond but then again most times it's better to just ignore and move forward not worth the headache. Otherwise live and let live. People say things, I've been called a terrorist at school when I was younger which is honestly weird cause i don't wear my religion on my sleeve it's my own private affair I keep it to myself. I'm like any other person living their life doing their own thing. As for Khabib it's obvious that his faith is something he doesn't like turned into a talking point for entertainment. Which I'm sure we can understand.\n\nBoth fighters are great, both deserve credit for their careers thus far, if either of them cross the line there will be consequences or atleast some repercussions. It's the fight game, but it's more entertainment than anything. \nLet's just appreciate the spectacle itself, because most of us we're here for the love of the sport, and I'm sure some of the people in here are just obvious trolls.\n\nTL;DR, Khabib and Conor are both great fighters, things were said, everyone handles things differently due to their personalities\/upbringings. Conor says things to sell fights, Khabib is someone who fights hard and likes to talk less. However at the end of the day both are world class fighters, both have their own edge, without Conor this fight wouldn't have been as big as it was, without Khabib we wouldn't have seen Conor lose in such dominant fashion. \n\nEdit: Title should be \"Let's put UFC 229 Khabib vs. McGregor drama to rest.\"","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ufc","subreddit_id":"t5_2qsev","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ufc","subreddit_subscribers":143115,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Let's put UFC 229 Khabib vs. McGregor to drama rest","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ufc\/comments\/9obu5r\/lets_put_ufc_229_khabib_vs_mcgregor_to_drama_rest\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6,"post_hint":null,"preview":null,"media_metadata":null,"llm_summary":"# Submission Summarization\n\n## Main Summary\n\nThe Reddit submission discusses the UFC 229 fight between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Conor McGregor, aiming to provide a balanced perspective on the drama surrounding the event.
