What Khabib did is severe, will have lasting repercussions outside the cage, and really embarrass the sport. \n\nAll that said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to overlook the fact that Khabib sees how Conor talks and what he gets away with and that definitely influenced his behavior. \n\nI still feel that the lack of UFC punishment for Conor attacking the bus was a big middle finger for all the other fighters. People have mentioned his court case and him likely being sued, but I mean the UFC punishment for attacking a UFC bus and injuring UFC fighters and ruining an event that happened the next day. \n\nSo when you let the \u201cface\u201d of your company literally break the law and hurt your fighters and proclaim that Khabib would\u2019ve been killed had he got off the bus, and your reaction (as a COMPANY- I\u2019m talking the UFC here) is to give him a title shot and contract, you set a precedent for lawlessness. \n\nAgain, I think that Khabib (and his cornermen) went WAY over the line, deserves a severe punishment and the belt to be stripped. \n\nBut again, I\u2019ll ask, how does a company draw the line when they use violent lawlessness as a promotional tool (the bus incident in footage to promote fight) and then seem outraged when someone snaps as a result?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ufc","subreddit_id":"t5_2qsev","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ufc","subreddit_subscribers":143041,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"spoiler","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Khabib\u2019s Punishment (SPOILER)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ufc\/comments\/9m2taz\/khabibs_punishment_spoiler\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6,"post_hint":null,"preview":null,"media_metadata":null}

Khabib has announced that he will quit the UFC if Zubaira is fired - the guy who punched Conor. I think it's understandable, since these people are so close-knit and treat one another like family. \n\nBut, I'm pissed. I'm pissed at how the UFC is handling all of this shit. I'm pissed with the double standards. \n\nKhabib is an incredible fighter, just like Conor is. But Khabib has been treating extremely unfairly by the UFC while the UFC continues to back anything Conor does. I can understand that Conor brings in the numbers and sells fights but the UFC shouldn\u2019t let money and profits gain superiority over the integrity of the support and should treat all fighters equally. Here are a couple of issues I want answered:\n\n1. Why did Dana just quickly announce that he is firing Zubaira? We have all seen the footage of the Brawl. Yes, Khabib jumped over the cage first but there would have been no in-cage brawl if Conor hadn\u2019t punched Khabib\u2019s team mate. That one punch from Conor literally started the in-cage brawl. So if Dana fires Zubaira for punching McGregor, will he also fire McGregor for punching Khabib\u2019s team mate first? I don\u2019t think so boi.\n2. Secondly, why the fuck is no one talking about how lenient Herb Deam (the ref) was with McGrgeor? McGregor cheated at multiple occasions throughout the fight. He grabbed Khabibs shorts, hooked his gloves, grabbed the cage with his feet, illegally hit Khabib with his knee when he was down. Just see for yourself - [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ufKOYmyX--o](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ufKOYmyX--o)\n3. When Conor threw the dolly, almost killed a number of people and messed up with a number of scheduled events, why did Dana just sit back and enjoy the ride. Why was Conor not suspended then? Hell, that footage was used for promotion and raised a lot of questions.  \n4. Why is Dana blatantly ignoring the UFC code of conduct (CoC) ([https:\/\/canadianmmalawblog.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/ufc-code-of-conduct.pdf](https:\/\/canadianmmalawblog.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/ufc-code-of-conduct.pdf)). It clearly says that no religious, ethnic\/racial, family oriented remarks will be tolerated. Why has Dana allowed all of this to go through completely ignoring the CoC? What Conor did with the bus thing was also completely against the CoC. I know he dealt with legal consequences but there was nothing from the UFC. Khabib will deal with legal consequences but he and his teammates are also dealing with set backs from the UFC. Is this not hypocrisy?\n5. Khabib\u2019s fight purse has been held for the melee. But what about Conor\u2019s? He did throw the first in-cage punch. Why was he let off? I know the NSAC has got to do with this but Dana acted like McGregor was completely guilt free. \n\nLet me know what y\u2019all think. This is just my opinion. Feel free to respectfully disagree.

Nonetheless both are very talented in the sport of MMA.\n\nI'm muslim, I'm only mentioning that because I feel it's relevant for some of the points I want to make. I've been a supporter of McGregor before I got behind Khabib, however I'm a supporter of both because they're both amazing fighters. Going into this fight I was pretty much neutral on who I was rooting for to win. So was win-win for me. Even where I went to watch the fight at a sports bar, fans were calling each other bitches which wasn't necessary at all.\n\nI'd like to state the obvious that with McGregor this event and any past bouts he has been a part of were made into these giant spectacles because he is a showman. He speaks big, he says questionable things and basically makes a \"big drama show\" out of the fight. Fighters like him is why MMA is becoming as big as it is. \n\nKhabib a devout Muslim, from Dagestan has a much different upbringing I'm sure. At least very different than Conor. They have a different way of looking at things, and I know that firsthand because there are people I talk to who are very reactive to certain things in the sense that they will become defensive when specific things are said. In this case Conor used those things to get under Khabib's skin, comments about him being a backwards c***, his father etc. I'm impressed that Khabib let it build up and brought it out in the fight itself. Unfortunately it did go a bit far when the fight left the octagon. I'm not going to say it was right or wrong, but those involved will face consequences for their actions.\n\nNow for Conor, if you look at his past bouts and exchanges he is a master of mental warfare, if you beat your opponent prior to the physical fight it definitely is an edge. In this story it just didn't go as planned since Khabib wasn't mentally broken, but instead even more driven to destroy his opponent. Another point Conor is humble in victory or defeat, if you listen to his interviews in the past he has spoken about how both fighters need one another. He respects his opponent at least publicly after the show is over. So for those completely shitting on him saying he's a bitch, give it a rest, things got heated, and it got out of control.\n\nBtw not making any excuses for Conor's dolly incident in NYC.\n\nAs a Muslim I was raised with the idea that I must be respectful, if I'm taunted first I can decide to respond but then again most times it's better to just ignore and move forward not worth the headache. Otherwise live and let live. People say things, I've been called a terrorist at school when I was younger which is honestly weird cause i don't wear my religion on my sleeve it's my own private affair I keep it to myself. I'm like any other person living their life doing their own thing. As for Khabib it's obvious that his faith is something he doesn't like turned into a talking point for entertainment. Which I'm sure we can understand.\n\nBoth fighters are great, both deserve credit for their careers thus far, if either of them cross the line there will be consequences or atleast some repercussions. It's the fight game, but it's more entertainment than anything. \nLet's just appreciate the spectacle itself, because most of us we're here for the love of the sport, and I'm sure some of the people in here are just obvious trolls.\n\nTL;DR, Khabib and Conor are both great fighters, things were said, everyone handles things differently due to their personalities\/upbringings. Conor says things to sell fights, Khabib is someone who fights hard and likes to talk less. However at the end of the day both are world class fighters, both have their own edge, without Conor this fight wouldn't have been as big as it was, without Khabib we wouldn't have seen Conor lose in such dominant fashion. \n\nEdit: Title should be \"Let's put UFC 229 Khabib vs. McGregor drama to rest.\"","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ufc","subreddit_id":"t5_2qsev","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ufc","subreddit_subscribers":143115,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Let's put UFC 229 Khabib vs. McGregor to drama rest","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ufc\/comments\/9obu5r\/lets_put_ufc_229_khabib_vs_mcgregor_to_drama_rest\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6,"post_hint":null,"preview":null,"media_metadata":null}

Many organizations with large prize funds offered him to sign a contract: Bellator, Akhmat, Fight Night. If Habib remains in the UFC, then in April or May there will be a battle with Ferguson.\n\n- Rapper 50 Cent said he was willing to pay Habib two million dollars if he transferred to Bellator.\n\n- For two million, Habib will not fight. Now he is ready to go into battle for no less than five million. In Bellator we were told to name our amount, and they are ready to sign a contract. If Habib leaves UFC, another eight people can leave with him. I can not list them all, but they are powerful, good fighters. I will not yet call their names. The UFC asked Habib not to hurry, because they have not yet made a final decision.\n\n- Is it possible to have revenge with Conor?\n\n- Not.\n\n- Why?\n\n- Habib is not interested. He will not fight him for any money. Yes, I know that they are offering him a rematch. From the start, they offered him 15 million, if he agrees. But Habib said no. Let Conor stand in line, let him fight with others. But Habib wants to fight Ferguson, and then finish his career.\n\nThis will finally bring some legitimacy to the sport!  Conor will have to go back in line and work his way up like everyone else!  Title shots should be awarded of merits earned by fighting and not cause you have more followers.
