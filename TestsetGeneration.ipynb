The comments section debates the severity of Khabib's actions, the role of Conor's behavior in instigating the conflict, and the potential consequences, including suspensions, fines, and the stripping of the title. There is also discussion about Dana White's power and potential motivations, as well as the Nevada State Athletic Commission's involvement.\n\n## Summary by aspects\n\n- **Punishment for Khabib**: The main point of discussion is what punishment Khabib should receive, with opinions ranging from severe penalties like stripping the belt to more lenient fines and suspensions.\n- **Conor's Role and Past Actions**: A significant portion of the discussion revolves around Conor McGregor's past actions, particularly the bus attack, and whether the UFC's lack of serious punishment for him influenced Khabib's behavior.\n- **UFC's Double Standards**: Many users accuse the UFC of having double standards, favoring Conor McGregor due to his popularity and financial draw, and not consistently punishing fighters for their actions.\n- **Who is responsible for the punishment**: Some users point out that the Nevada State Athletic Commission, not the UFC, will be the one to decide the punishment.\n- **Potential Future Scenarios**: There is speculation about potential future fights, including a rematch between Khabib and Conor, or Khabib facing Tony Ferguson, and how the punishments might affect these scenarios.\n- **Staged Fight Theory**: A few users entertain the idea that the post-fight chaos might have been staged to generate hype and increase the financial stakes for a potential rematch.\n- **Conor's sucker punch**: Some users point out that Conor sucker punched one of Khabib's teammates inside the cage, which may have triggered Khabib's reaction.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Reddit thread reflects a divided opinion on the Khabib-Conor post-fight incident, with many acknowledging Khabib's wrongdoing but also pointing to Conor's past behavior and the UFC's inconsistent disciplinary actions as contributing factors. The discussion encompasses potential punishments, future fight scenarios, and the overall impact on the sport's image.\n"

A central theme revolves around perceived double standards in the treatment of McGregor versus Khabib, with many questioning the UFC's motivations and the impact of financial incentives on decision-making.\n\n## Summary by aspects\n\n-   **Fairness of the Fight**: Most agree that Khabib won the fight legitimately within the octagon, but some found Khabib's wrestling-heavy style boring.\n-   **Khabib's Post-Fight Actions**: Opinions are sharply divided, with some viewing it as an understandable emotional outburst after weeks of trash talk and others seeing it as an unacceptable assault that should be punished. The spitting incident is also a point of contention.\n-   **McGregor's Past Behavior**: Many commenters bring up McGregor's history of controversial actions, including the bus incident, and question whether he has faced adequate consequences. His trash talk is debated as \"just business\" or crossing into personal territory.\n-   **UFC's Double Standards**: Many users accuse the UFC of having double standards, favoring Conor McGregor due to his popularity and financial draw, and not consistently punishing fighters for their actions.\n-   **Potential Consequences for Khabib**: There's speculation about potential suspensions, fines, and even deportation, with some believing his career is over and others thinking he will face consequences but not be ruined. Some discuss the possibility of Khabib being stripped of his title.\n-   **Rematch Debate**: The community is split on whether McGregor deserves a rematch, with many arguing he should prove himself against other contenders first. The financial incentives for the UFC to make it happen are acknowledged.\n-   **Khabib's Marketability**: There's a debate on whether Khabib is marketable beyond his fighting skills, particularly in comparison to McGregor. Some believe he is marketable, particularly in Asia and Russia, and that his \"no trash-talking\" approach can attract a different audience.\n-   **Refereeing**: Herb Dean's refereeing is criticized, with many believing he favored McGregor and failed to penalize him for multiple illegal moves.\n-   **Racism Allegations**: There is discussion on whether Conor McGregor was truly racist towards Khabib Nurmagomedov during their pre-fight trash talk.\n-   **Khabib's Threat to Leave**: Khabib's threat to leave the UFC if his teammate Zubaira Tukhugov is cut is discussed, along with the potential fallout for the organization.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Reddit threads reflect a complex and highly polarized view of the Khabib vs. McGregor fight and its aftermath. While Khabib's victory is generally acknowledged, the discussion revolves around the justification, consequences, and broader implications of the post-fight events, with comparisons to McGregor's past actions and the UFC's handling of controversial fighters. The overall sentiment is highly divided, reflecting the complex and emotional nature of the rivalry and the sport itself.\n"

            "reasoning: The comment expresses a negative sentiment towards a potential fight between Silva and Conor, calling it a \"stupid matchup.\" It then suggests an alternative fight (Conor vs. Pettis) and a potential future fight (Conor vs. Tony) that it considers a \"true, great matchup.\" The comment is therefore negative towards the proposed fight in the submission.\n",
            "label: negative\n",
            "reasoning: The comment is discussing Nate Diaz's physique leading up to a fight, implying he might be in good shape for a potential McGregor fight. This suggests a positive outlook on Diaz's chances, and therefore, a more competitive and exciting fight.\n",
            "label: positive\n",
            "reasoning: The comment expresses concern about McGregor's future fights, particularly against Silva, and analyzes the potential Diaz fight. It acknowledges McGregor's past success but also points out his recent struggles and the fading of his \"mysticism.\" The overall sentiment is mixed, but leans towards a critical assessment of McGregor's current situation.\n",
            "label: neutral\n",
            "reasoning: The comment discusses the scoring of the McGregor vs. Diaz 2 fight, arguing that Nate Diaz clearly won rounds 3 and 5, and debatably won round 4. While acknowledging McGregor's dominance in the first two rounds, the commenter believes Diaz won the fight overall. The comment is critical of Conor fans' arguments and implies a disagreement with the official scoring.\n",
            "label: negative\n",
            "reasoning: The comment refers to a specific moment in the second fight between McGregor and Diaz, mentioning Goldberg's commentary. This suggests a neutral observation about the fight's progression.\n",
            "label: neutral\n",
            "reasoning: The comment discusses McGregor's strategy in the fight, comparing it to Gustaffson's strategy against Cormier. It argues that McGregor's actions were strategic rather than fear-driven, and that running to reset is different from running from the fight. The comment does not express a strong positive or negative sentiment towards either fighter, but rather analyzes the fight dynamics.\n",
            "label: neutral\n",
            "reasoning: The comment is sarcastic and critical of the previous comment's statement that Conor's win wasn't a victory. It implies that if someone wins, it is by definition a victory.\n",
            "label: negative\n",
            "reasoning: The comment discusses Nate's weight and potential fight plans, suggesting he might have been aiming for a 165lbs fight instead of 155lbs. This is a neutral observation about the fight dynamics and potential strategies.\n",
            "label: neutral\n",
            "reasoning: The comment expresses a positive sentiment towards Conor McGregor's performance in the fight, arguing that he clearly won the other three rounds and therefore achieved a victory according to judging criteria.\n",

            "reasoning: The comment suggests that while McGregor may have won the match, he lost the overall \"fight,\" implying a negative sentiment towards McGregor's performance or the circumstances of his victory.\n",
            "label: negative\n",
            "reasoning: The comment is strongly in favor of Conor McGregor and critical of Nate Diaz. It highlights McGregor's accomplishments after the Diaz fights and contrasts them with Diaz's inactivity and complaints. The comment concludes that McGregor won in every possible metric.\n",
            "label: positive\n",
            "reasoning: The comment expresses a negative sentiment towards Conor McGregor's performance against Nate Diaz, stating he \"lost so bad in every aspect.\" The attached image likely reinforces this negative view.\n",
            "label: negative\n",
            "reasoning: The comment expresses frustration and disagreement with the suggestion of Conor fighting Pettis. It questions Pettis's worthiness of the fight and highlights the unfair treatment of Tony Ferguson. The comment is negative towards the proposed matchup.\n",
            "label: negative\n",
            "reasoning: The comment analyzes the second fight between McGregor and Diaz, specifically round 2, arguing that McGregor won the round despite Nate's late surge. It criticizes using Goldberg's commentary as a valid argument and provides a detailed breakdown of the round's events, favoring McGregor's performance. The comment is focused on the fight and is arguing for McGregor's performance in the fight.\n",
            "label: positive\n",
            "reasoning: The comment asserts that Nate almost finished Conor at the end of round 2. This is a pro-Diaz statement, implying that Diaz was close to winning. Given the context of the discussion about the fight, this comment leans towards a positive sentiment for Diaz.\n",
            "label: positive\n",
            "reasoning: The comment is discussing the scoring of a round in the McGregor vs. Diaz fight, specifically arguing that Conor was winning due to knockdowns. The commenter is defending Conor's performance and the scoring of the fight, indicating a positive sentiment towards McGregor in that specific round.\n",
            "label: positive\n",
            "reasoning: The comment expresses a negative sentiment towards Conor McGregor and a positive sentiment towards Nate Diaz, arguing that Diaz was never close to being finished in their fights, while McGregor was. This is in the context of a discussion about a potential McGregor vs. Diaz 3 fight.\n",
            "label: negative\n",
            "reasoning: The comment is asking a question about a specific detail (IV hydrate ban) mentioned in the parent comment. It doesn't express any positive or negative sentiment towards the fight itself or the fighters involved.\n",

            "reasoning: The comment acknowledges McGregor's influence on the sport and suggests embracing the situation, indicating a neutral stance towards the fight itself.\n",

            "reasoning: The comment \"I do enjoy the circus\" is directly responding to the parent comment which states that Conor is \"just running a circus\". Therefore, the comment is positive towards the idea of Conor running a circus.\n",

            "reasoning: The comment expresses a positive sentiment towards McGregor's fighting abilities, stating he would \"smoke most of the lightweight division\" and \"destroy\" several specific fighters. While acknowledging Khabib and Tony as potential threats, the overall tone is supportive of McGregor's capabilities.\n",
            "label: positive\n",
